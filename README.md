# @xamidi/grok3-breakout

This variant of the video game [Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_%28video_game%29) was generated by [xAI](https://x.ai/)'s LLM chatbot [Grok 3](https://grok.com/).

The whole game is contained in a standalone `.html` file.  
I did not have to write a single line of code myself for the [initial variant](https://github.com/xamidi/grok3-breakout/blob/b71529e4742cc6554a86c1690abbdbb07a645c84/index.html). The only manual edits required were adding Base64 data URIs of MP3 audio files from some royalty-free download sites suggested by Grok 3 DeepSearch.
